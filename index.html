    <!-- â€‹React and ReactDOM are provided as separate files to promote modularity and flexibility within the React ecosystem. 
    This separation allows React to be utilized across various platforms, not just web browsers. For instance, 
    React can be employed in mobile applications through React Native, which doesn't require DOM-specific methods. 
    By isolating the DOM-related functionalities into ReactDOM, React remains adaptable for different environments. -->
